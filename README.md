#### Javascript 3D Engine ####

The aim of this project is to create a lightweight 3D engine with a very low level of abstraction (aka for dummies). Currently there is no documentation available but feel free to use the examples as a reference and/or read the source code. However, be aware that the API may change from revision to revision breaking compatibility.

The engine can render using &lt;canvas&gt;, &lt;svg&gt; and WebGL.
